# Factom

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/FactomProject/factomd/tree/develop.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/FactomProject/factomd/tree/develop)

Factom is an Open-Source project that provides a way to build applications on the Bitcoin blockchain. 

Factom began by providing proof of existence services, but then move on to provide proof of existence of transforms. A list of such entries can be thought of as a Factom Chain.  Factom can be used to implement private tokens, smart contracts, smart properties, and more.

Factom leverages the Bitcoin Blockchain, but in a way that minimizes the amount of data actually inserted in the Blockchain. Thus it provides a mechanism for creating Bitcoin 2.0 services for the trading of assets, securities, commodities, or other complex applications without increasing blockchain "pollution".


## Getting Started

You need to set up Go environment with golang 1.12 or higher (but not above the verion listed [here](https://github.com/FactomProject/factomd/blob/master/engine/factomParams.go#L140) ). You also need git.  See the [Install from source](https://github.com/FactomProject/FactomDocs/blob/master/installFromSourceDirections.md) directions for more details and wallet installation instructions.

### Install factomd Full Node

```
git clone https://github.com/FactomProject/factomd
cd factomd
make
# or `make install` to install factomd into GOBIN folder

# you can optionally use a config file to run in a non-standard mode
# mkdir -p ~/.factom/m2/
# cp factomd.conf ~/.factom/m2/
```

## M2 Simulator 

factomd can run a simulated network via the commandline.  This allows testing of much more complicated networks than would be possible otherwise.   The  simulator is very extensible, so new features will be added as we go along.

### Flags to control the simulator

The flags that begin with "test." are supplied by the profiling package installed.  The flags that relate to running factomd and the simulator are the following, with a little more explaination.  That follows below.

### Simulator Commands

While the simulator is running, you can perform a number of commands to poke at, and examine the state of factomd:

* aN -- Dump the Admin block at directory block height N. So like a1 or a213. Currently just dumps the JSON. 
* fN -- Dump the Factoid block at directory block height N.  So like f5 or f1203.  Pretty prints.
* dN -- Dump the Directory block at directory block height N.  d4 or d21230
* <enter> -- gives the state of all nodes in the simulated network.
* D -- Dumps all the messages in the system to standard out, including the directory blocks and the process lists.
* l -- Attempt to make this server a leader (must have a valid identity to become one) 
* o -- Attempt to make this server an auditor (must have a valid identity to become one) 
* s -- Show the state of all nodes as their state changes in the simulator.
* i -- Shows the current identities being monitored for changes
* u -- shows the current authorities (federated/audit servers)
* N -- typing a node number shifts focus.  You now are talking to said node from the CLI or wallet

### Simulator Commands Continued -- Identity
M2 requires servers to have identities if they wish to have the ability to become a federated or audit server. To create an identity, entries must be entered into the blockchain, so controls were added to the simulator to assist in the creation and attachment of identities. Identites take about a minute to generate on a (macbook pro laptop) to meet the proper requirements, so a stack of identities are pregenerated to make testing easier.

How the simulator controls work. First every instance of factomd will share the same stack of identites. Each instance will also have a local pool of identities they can use and attach to their nodes. To load their local pool of identities, they can pop identities off the shared stack, then attach the next open identity in their local identity pool to the current node:

* gN -- Moves N identities from the shared stack to local identity pool
  * Be mindful everyone shares the stack and it can run out.
* t -- Attaches the next identity in the local pool that has not been taken to the current node

<i>The 'gN' command will load entry credits into the zeros entry credit wallet to fund all identity sim controls if the wallet is low on funds. </i>

### Launching Factomd
 
Personally I open two consoles.  I run factomd redirected to out.txt, and in another console I run tail -f out.txt.

So in one console I run a command like:

	factomd -count=10 -net=tree > out.txt
	
And in another console I run:

	tail -f out.txt
	
Then I type commands in the first console as described above, and see the output in the second.  Also messages and errors will show up in the first console (leaving the second console with simple output from factomd).

### -count

The command:
	
	factomd -count=10

Will run the simulator with the configuration found in ~/.factom/m2/factom.conf with 10 nodes, named fnode0 to fnode9.  fnode0 will be the leader.  When you hit enter to get the status, you will see an "L" next to leader nodes.

### -db

You can override the database implementation used to run the simulator.  The options are "Bolt", "LDB", and "Map".  "Bolt" will give you a bolt database, "LDB" will get you a LevelDB database, and "Map" will get you a hashtable based database (i.e. nothing stored to disk).  The most common use of -db is to specify a "Map" database for tests that can be easily rerun without concern for past runs of the tests, or of messing up the database state.

For example, you can run a 10 node Factom network in memory with the following command:

	factoid -count=10 -db=Map
	
### -net

The network is constructed using one of a number of algorithms.  tree is the default, and looks like this, where 0 is connected to 1 and 2, 1 is connected to 3 and 4, 2 is connected to 4 and 5, etc.

	                      0
	                   1     2
	                3     4     5
	             6     7     8     9
	             ...

circles is a bit hard to map out but it is a series of loops of seven nodes, where each loop is connected to about a 1/3 down from the previous loop, 2/3 down the loop prior to that one (if it exists) and 1/2 the circle 2 prior (if it exists). The goal is to maximize the number of alternate routes to later nodes to test timing of messages through the network.

long is just one long chain of nodes

loops creates a long chain of nodes that have short cuts added here and there.

Running a particular network configuration looks like:

	factomd -count=30 -net=tree
	factomd -count=30 -net=circles
	factomd -count=30 -net=long
	factomd -count=30 -net=loops
	
### -node

The simulator always keeps the focus on one node or another.  Some commands are node sensitive (printing directory blocks, etc.), and the walletapp and factom-cli talk to the node in focus.  This allows you to set the node in focus from the beginning.  Mostly a developer thing.

	factom -count=30 -node=15 -net=tree
	
Would start up with node 15 as the focus.

### -p2pAddress

This opens up a TCP port and listens for new connections.

Usage:
	-p2pAddress="tcp://:8108"

### -peers

This connects to a remote computer and passes messages and blocks between them.

	-peers="tcp://192.168.1.69:8108" 

### -prefix

This makes all the simnodes in this process followers.  It prefixes the text provided to the Node names (and the generated file names) of all the Factom instances created.   So without a prefix, you would get nodes named FNode0, FNode1, etc.  With the a_ prefix described below, you would get a_FNode0, a_FNode1, etc.

FNode0 is currently a "magic name", and the node with that name becomes the first default Leader when building Factom up from scratch.  (Of course, if you are loading an existing network, it will come up with the last set of leaders).   In any event, adding the prefix avoids having FNode0 as a name, and as a result all the nodes will be followers.

	-prefix=a_

Multi-computer example:
Computer Leader (ip x.69) `factomd -count=2 -p2pAddress="tcp://:8108" -peers="tcp://192.168.1.72:8108"`
Computer Follower (ip x.72) `factomd -count=5 -p2pAddress="tcp://:8108" -peers="tcp://192.168.1.69:8108" -follower=true -prefix=a_`
