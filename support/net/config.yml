network:
    # Initial rules for the network, use it to set up the initial topology of
    # the network (nodes + seed_server).
    # By default all nodes are connected, you can use deny or allow rules to
    # override this. Rules are evaluated in order, so whenever a rule is matched
    # the processing is stopped. Note that the seed_server is considered a node
    # in the network, so blocking access for a node to the whole network means
    # that it will not be able to access the seed_server.
    #
    # Example:
    #
    # Given nodes: A, B, C and the following set of rules:
    #  - allow: B -> A
    #  - deny: * <-> A
    # will result in the following network:
    #  A <- B <-> C
    # (-> denotes a one-way connection and <-> a two-way connection).
    rules:
          # allow or deny
        - action: deny
          # a node name or "*" for the whole network
          source: node2
          # a node name or "*" for the whole network
          target: "*"
          # if true, the rule is applied one-way (source -> target), if false,
          # the rule is applied both ways (source <-> target), default: false
          one-way: true
