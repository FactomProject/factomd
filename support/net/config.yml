# List of factom nodes
nodes:
    - name: node1  # the name of the node, should be unique in the environment
      seed: true   # if true, the node address will be added to the list of
                   # seeds available when factomd are starting, default: false

    - name: node2

    - name: node3

# Initial rules for the network, use to set up the initial topology of the
# network (nodes + seed_server).
# By default all nodes are connected, you can use deny or allow rules to
# override this. Rules are evaluated in order, so whenever a rule is matched
# the processing is stopped. Note that the seed_server is considered a node in
# the network, so blocking access for a node to the whole network means that it
# will not be able to access the seed_server.
#
# Example:
#
# Given nodes: A, B, C and the following set of rules:
#  - allow: B -> A
#  - deny: * <-> A
# will result in the following network:
#  A <- B <-> C
# (-> denotes a one-way connection and <-> a two-way connection).

network:
    rules:
        - action: deny    # allow or deny
          source: node2   # a node name or "*" for the whole network
          target: "*"     # a node name or "*" for the whole network
          one-way: false  # if true, the rule is applied one-way (source ->
                          # target), if false, the rule is applied both ways
                          # (source <-> target), default: false
        - action: deny
          source: node3
